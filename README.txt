XCOM Reach, a total conversion by the Inventorum Development Team

A small total conversion, focused on the Fall of Reach: a major battle in the Halo universe, fought on the fortress world of Reach. Six weeks of intense combat for the humankind's main military hub and one of the last human-controlled worlds. 
#Halo Wars style mod - Created in 2014 by Diemaco for no good reason, improved and expanded in 2021 by IDT efrenespartano & Ikhanad 'cause we love Halo
