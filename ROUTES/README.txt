Reach: The Fall, a total conversion by the Inventorum Development Team for OpenXcom Extended

A small total conversion, focused on the Fall of Reach: a major battle in the Halo universe, fought on the fortress world. Six weeks of intense combat for the humankind's main military hub and one of the last human-controlled worlds. 
#Halo Wars style mod - Created in 2014 by Diemaco for no good reason, improved and expanded in 2021-2022 by the Inventorum Development Team 'cause we love Halo
