  STR_PLASMA_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "A powerful long-range weapon, seen occasionally since 2526, but identified only last year. Instead of employing superheated plasma, it fires radioactive projectiles of an extremely toxic exotic material, not found on the periodic table. It fires at supersonic speed. It features a sight that is somewhat cumbersome to use, but allows for accurate firing once the user gets used to it."
  STR_FUEL_ROD_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "A launcher of heavy radioactive projectiles composed of an incendiary gel that explodes violently on contact.

Its battery is consumed with each thrust and can be recharged."
  STR_JACKAL_SHIELD_GAUNTLET_UFOPEDIA: "Employed on the forearm of Jackal soldiers, this shield employs a 'linear energy field' that deflects projectiles and absorbs projectile energy until the energy generator is saturated and collapses. The color of the shield reflects the user's rank."

  STR_BATTLE_OF_SIGMA_OCTANUS_IV_EVENT: "Battle of Sigma Octanus IV"
  STR_BATTLE_OF_SIGMA_OCTANUS_IV_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "A major victory for the UNSC has just taken place on the fourth planet of the Sigma Octanus system. The enemy force jumped into the system cloaked, but the brave action of the UNSC destroyer Iroquois allowed more time for a fleet of 48 Navy ships, which engaged a Covenant fleet in an impressive naval battle. UNSC troops and a SPARTAN-II squadron managed to maintain control of the planet's surface. This victory is certainly as important as the Liberation of Harvest."
  STR_WINTER_CONTINGENCY_EVENT: "WINTER CONTIGENCY Activated."
  STR_WINTER_CONTINGENCY_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The Army's special operations squad, NOBLE Team, has confirmed the presence of Covenant forces in Reach. This corroborates the sighting of several unknown signals in other parts of the planet. All military forces have been mobilized to counterattack the enemy before they can establish a beachhead."
  STR_BATTLE_SZURDOK_RIDGE_EVENT: "Battle of Szurdok Ridge"
  STR_BATTLE_SZURDOK_RIDGE_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "A long offensive has taken place on the plains of Ütközet, where the presence of tower-like Covenant structures known as 'Spires' has been confirmed. The purpose of these is unknown, although it is believed to project an energy shield protecting enemy camps and forward bases. Our troops achieved a tactical victory, but the Covenant unveiled their presence on the planet, a CSO-class Super Carrier. Alternatives to combat this capital ship are being analyzed."
  STR_OPERATION_UPPER_CUT_EVENT: "Operation UPPER CUT"
  STR_OPERATION_UPPER_CUT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Through a daring raid on the CSO-class Super Carrier by NOBLE Team and Army airmen, the impressive enemy warship was successfully destroyed. A slipspace breach within the CSO was confirmed. However, shortly thereafter reports came in of numerous Covenant ships jumping directly over the planet. We should prepare for the worst."
  STR_EVACUATION_EFFORTS_ONGOING_EVENT: "Evacuation efforts underway"
  STR_EVACUATION_EFFORTS_ONGOING_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Civilian evacuation ships, escorted by the Navy, have managed to get numerous citizens off the planet out of the war zones. The enemy is particularly keen to shoot them down, but our efforts controlling Reach airspace have enabled such evacuation operations. Keep it up! Our fighters clear the way."
  STR_EVACUATION_HALTED_EVENT: "Evacuations cancelled at {0}"
  STR_EVACUATION_HALTED_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The evacuation post set up by UNSC armed forces has been overrun by Covenant infantry and their defenses overwhelmed. There are reports of a Heavy Corvette that has been shooting down evacuation ferries leaving the area. High Command has cancelled evacuations from this point until further notice."
  STR_UNSC_FLEET_INCOMING_EVENT: "UNSC Fleet en route"
  STR_UNSC_FLEET_INCOMING_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "As of two days ago, High Command has ordered 60% of the fleets near the Epsilon Eridani system to return to Reach and support in planetary defense. They are expected to arrive in the next few hours, although the difficulties and low accuracy of the slipspace jumps complicate the coordination of the newly arrived ships."
  STR_UNSC_FORCES_ENGAGED_IN_COMBAT_EVENT: "UNSC forces engaging the enemy."
  STR_UNSC_FORCES_ENGAGED_IN_COMBAT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "According to the WINTER CONTIGENCY, our infantry and armored forces are engaged in intense combat across the planet's surface. Tactical withdrawals are not ceasing, but at least we are keeping the Covenant at bay."
  STR_COVENANT_GLASSING_EVENT: "Covenant ships glass {0}"
  STR_COVENANT_GLASSING_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "All communication has been lost with UNSC garrisons in the city. Latest reports confirm the sighting of multiple CSS-class Battlecruisers above the urban core, as well as high levels of plasma radiation. This confirms that the city has been glassed. Casualties are yet unknown."
  STR_COVENANT_FLEET_INCOMING_EVENT: "Slipspace ruptures detected."
  STR_COVENANT_FLEET_INCOMING_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Our long-range sensors have detected a huge signal coming from delayspace. A gigantic fleet has jumped into the system, the likes of which we have never seen before. Our ships are overwhelmed and the Orbital Defense Platforms are not enough to keep the Covenant at bay. It is possible that the planet is on the verge of collapse."

The Scanner display shows an arrow in the center which is the direction the soldier is facing (North is at the top). The flashing blobs show units which have moved recently. Large units, or fast moving units, will produce larger blobs. Static units will not be detected."
  STR_MEDI_KIT_UFOPEDIA: "The medi-kit combines a healing facility with pain killers and stimulants. In order to use the medi-kit you must face towards the soldier requiring treatment. If the soldier is stunned you must stand over the body. Click on the medi-kit icon and select 'use medi-kit' from the menu.{NEWLINE}HEALING> Red body parts show fatal wounds. Click on a body part that is wounded. Click on the 'Heal' button.
